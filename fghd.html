        <h1  id="tej">Types of violence</h1>

           <p style="color:blueviolet"> Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence
             carried out by individuals as well as states. Some of the forms of violence perpetrated 
            by individuals are: rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment, acid throwing, reproductive
             coercion, female infanticide, prenatal sex selection, obstetric violence, and mob violence;
             as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as honor killings, dowry 
            violence, female genital mutilation, marriage by abduction and forced marriage. 
            There are forms of violence which may be perpetrated or condoned by the government,
             such as war rape; sexual violence and sexual slavery during conflict; forced sterilization;
             forced abortion; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; stoning and flogging.
             Many forms of VAW, such as trafficking in women and forced prostitution are often 
            perpetrated by organized criminal networks.[6] Histrorically, there have been forms of 
            organized WAV, such as the Witch trials in the early modern period or the sexual slavery
             of the Comfort women.
            
            The World Health Organization (WHO), in its research on VAW, has analyzed and categorized the different forms of VAW occurring through all stages of life from before birth to old age.

					<h2>Rape</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(226, 141, 43)">
                        Women are most often the victims of rape, which is usually perpetrated by men known to them.[55] The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions, and reflects to some extent the society's attitudes to such crimes. It is considered the most underreported violent crime.[56][57] Following a rape, a victim may face violence or threats of violence from the rapist, and, in many cultures, from the victim's own family and relatives. Violence or intimidation of the victim may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the
                         rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or it may be
                          perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This
                           is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory
                            before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in honor killings. Victims may also be 
                            forced by their families to marry the rapist in order to restore the family's "honor".[58] In Lebanon, 
                            the Campaign Against Lebanese Rape Law - Article 522 was launched in December 2016 to abolish the article
                             that permitted a rapist to escape prison by marrying his victim.Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by police during 2008 varied between 0.1 per 100,000 people in Egypt and 91.6 per 100,000 people in Lesotho with 4.9 per 100,000 people in Lithuania as the median.[59] In some countries, rape is not reported or 
                        properly recorded by police because of the consequences on the victim and the stigma attached to it</p>
                        
					
					<h2>Domestic violence</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(29, 194, 29)"> 
                        Domestic violence
                         (also named domestic abuse or family violence) is violence or other abuse in a domestic setting, such as in 
                         marriage or cohabitation. Domestic violence may be used as a synonym for intimate partner violence, which 
                         is committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, 
                         and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. 
                         In the broadest sense, domestic violence can also involve violence against children, parents,
                          or the elderly.</p>
					
				
                    <h2>Acid throwing</h2>
                    <p style="color:rgb(63, 7, 28)">
					An acid attack,[1] also called acid throwing, vitriol attack, or vitriolage, is a form of violent assault[2][3][4] involving the act of throwing acid or a similarly corrosive substance onto the body of another "with the intention to disfigure, maim, torture, or kill".[5] Perpetrators of these attacks throw corrosive liquids at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones. Acid attacks can often lead to permanent blindness.</p>
		
					<h2>Restrictions on freedom of movement</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(223, 219, 15)"> Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence. Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. ... No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.</p>
					
					<h2>Stalking</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(27, 7, 10)"> Stalking is unwanted and/or 
                        repeated surveillance by an individual or group toward another person.[1] Stalking behaviors are interrelated to harassment
                         and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them. The term stalking is used with some
                          differing definitions in psychiatry and psychology, as well as in some legal jurisdictions as a term for a criminal offense</p>
					
					<h2>Cyberbullying</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(40, 54, 6)">
                      Cyberbullying or cyberharassment is 
                        a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying.
                         It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers, as the digital sphere has expanded and technology has advanced
                         .[1] Cyberbullying is when someone, typically a teenager, bullies or harasses others on the internet and in other digital 
                         spaces, particularly on social media sites.</p>
					
					<h2>Violence against trans women</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(20, 131, 112)">    
                        Transgender individuals and communities experience shocking amounts of violence and discrimination. This section offers some information on the staggering rates of violence that trans and non-binary people face, although it should be noted that data is limited. In addition to experiencing high rates of domestic and sexual violence, trans and non-binary people are often the targets of transphobic hate crimes and state violence.</p>
					
					<h2>Sexual harassment</h2>
                       <p style="color:rgb(226, 43, 43)">Sexual harassment is a type of harassment technique with explicit or implicit sexual overtones, including the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from verbal transgressions to sexual abuse or assault.</p>
					
					<h2>Female genital mutilation</h2>
					<p style="color:rgb(35, 5, 63)">
                      The reasons why female genital mutilations are performed vary from one region to another as well as over time, and include a mix of sociocultural factors within families and communities.</p>
					
					<h2>Violence against indigenous women</h2>
                    <p style="color:rgb(112, 4, 22)">
                        Violence, both overt and covert, is central to the lives of many Aboriginal women. The reality of this violence has been masked until now, first, by open intimidation of Black Australian women by the men in their communities who bash and rape and, second, by a more subtle </p>
